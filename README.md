# My Flipper payloads

Collection of safe, benign BadUSB payloads and testing notes for i3 Linux
and other targets. Only for devices I own or have permission to test.

### The objectve of this repo is to learn!

## safety first

- Only run payloads on machines you own or have explicit permission to test
- Test in VMs with USB passthrough first, use snapshots
- Check keyboard layout before running payloads
- Prefer base64 encoded server-side execution to avoid layout issues
